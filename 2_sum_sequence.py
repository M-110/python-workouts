"""
The challenge here is to write a mysum function that does the same thing as 
the built-in sum function. However, instead of taking a single sequence as a 
parameter, it should take a variable number of arguments. Thus, although you 
might invoke sum([1,2,3]), youâ€™d instead invoke mysum(1,2,3) or 
mysum(10,20,30,40,50).
