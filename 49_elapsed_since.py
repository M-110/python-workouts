"""
In this exercise, write a generator function whose argument must be iterable. 
With each iteration, the generator will return a two-element tuple. The first 
element in the tuple will be an integer indicating how many seconds have 
passed since the previous iteration. The tupleâ€™s second element will be the 
next item from the passed argument.
